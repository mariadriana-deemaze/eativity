# Eativity

This is a full-stack TypeScript mobile application developed using React Native and wrapped within the Expo SDK. For the app's user interface, I am utilizing the NativeBase library, while on the backend, I am leveraging ORM Prisma services through a NestJS application.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- Typescript
- NativeBase
- NestJS
- Prisma

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn i` on each `/app` and `/backend` folders.
3. To start the app with a quick dev start, run the commands: 
- `yarn dev:be` 
- `yarn dev:app`

## Features

- User authentication

## Dependencies

- `react-native`
- `expo`
- `typescript`
- `nestJS`
- `prisma`

## Running the app UI

To run the app, use the following command:

```shell
yarn dev:app

This will start the Expo development server and open the app in your default browser. You can then use the Expo client app to run the app on your mobile device.

## Running the app backend

To run the app backend services, use the following command:

```shell
yarn dev:be
```
